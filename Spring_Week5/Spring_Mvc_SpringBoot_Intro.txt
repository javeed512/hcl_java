In Old way of creating Spring Web MVC/ Java Web project
1. External Tomcat server
2. Jars file
3. Maven tool
4. We need to search and copy all depencencies manually (pom.xml file).
5. spring xml config file 
6. External Databases.


Spring Boot:
-----------
1. It has Embedded Tomcat server(run on port:8080)
2. It has maven tool by default
3. It has options to select what depencencies we need so that it can add them in pom.xml (by itself)
4. It gives application.properties file where we can prove configuration easily 
(no head ache of learning xml)
5. It give Embedded Database like H2 (no need to depend on external DBs)

Note: Springboot does not support jsp




We can create Spring Boot Project in 3 ways:
---------------------------------------------
1. STS ---> In sts , goto new--> select --> spring starter project option  
2. Goto spring.io / spring initilizr and create project
Note: In above step you will get zip file , extract zip file and import project in Eclipse.
3. Spring CLI ---> Command line interface  (not for you)



http://localhost:8080/hello
